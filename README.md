# Akka cluster test

I've been seeing some weird and counter-intuitive behaviour when working with Akka.NET and clustered broadcast groups. This stuff is still a lot quicker to try out in Scala (and that's coming from someone who's barely used it) so here we are. It works as expected. Now to see if I can translate this back into an Akka.NET version :-)
