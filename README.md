# Akka cluster test

I've created 2 simple implementations (both as similar as possible) in both [Akka.NET](https://github.com/tintoy/akkadotnet-cluster-test) and [Akka native (scala)](https://github.com/tintoy/akkadotnet-cluster-test).

The native one works, but I can't figure out why the .NET one doesn't.
